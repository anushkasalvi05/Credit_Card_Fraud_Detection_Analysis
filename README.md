# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Analysis
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Analyzing data from January 2019 to December 2020, we apply Random Forest and Logistic Regression models, focusing on merchant-level risk, time-based fraud patterns, and spending behavior to improve fraud detection accuracy.
